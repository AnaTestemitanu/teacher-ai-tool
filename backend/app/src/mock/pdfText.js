export const pdfText = `The Soviet Union and the USA had fought on the same side against Hitler's
Germany in the Second World War. Once the war was over and Germany was
defeated, problems started. The two countries found that they could not work
together. The main problem was that the USA was capitalist and the Soviet Union
was communist. They did not trust each other.

Instead of being allies, they drifted into a ‘cold’ war. This was war where both
sides threatened each other with words, spied on each other and built nuclear
weapons. However, they never actually fought each other.

When the Second World War ended, Europe was split into two halves. The
West was capitalist and the East was communist, controlled by the Soviet
Red Army. The Soviet Union tried to strengthen its control in Europe while
the USA tried to weaken the control the Soviet Union had over eastern
European countries.

In this chapter you will find out:

- how ideological differences helped bring about the Cold War and how they
affected attempts to reach agreement on how Europe should be governed

- how US / Soviet rivalry in the years 1947-49 led to the division of Europe
into ‘two camps’

- how the development of the atomic bomb led to an arms race

- how opposition to Soviet control led to an unsuccessful uprising in Hungary.

Learning outcomes

- Know about the political outlooks of the communist Soviet Union and capitalist USA.

- Understand how, as allies during the Second World War, the Soviet Union, the USA, and Britain formed plans
for the future government of Europe.

- Understand how the alliance turned to rivalry and distrust when the Second World War was over.

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union, the USA and Britain were allies fighting against Nazi
Germany. Britain’s prime minister, Winston Churchill, nicknamed this alliance ‘The Grand Alliance’. As soon as
it became clear that Hitler would be defeated, tension and rivalry between the Soviet Union and the other
allies began to grow. This became the Cold War.

Ideological differences between East and West

The Soviet Union, Britain and the USA were ruled according to very different ideologies. Britain and the
USA were capitalist. The Soviet Union was communist.

Political outlook The way a government believes their country should be run.

Soviet Union Known as the USSR. It was a group of communist countries. It was controlled by Russia.

Ideology A set of shared beliefs. In 1941, the USA and the Soviet Union had different ideologies concerning
how a country should be run.

Capitalism Capitalists believe everyone should be free to own property and businesses and make money. The USA
was a capitalist country.

Communism Communists believe that all property, including homes and businesses, should belong to the state, to
ensure that every member of society has a fair share. The Soviet Union was communist.

Cold War A war where the sides threaten each other but do not actually fight.

Differences between leaders

Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin (the leaders of the USA, Britain and the Soviet Union in 1941) are often called ‘the
Big Three’. Churchill and Roosevelt did not trust Stalin, and he did not trust them. The differences in the leaders’
personal political beliefs were a major factor in the breakdown of relations as the Second World War ended.

Differences between nations

During the 1930s, both the USA and Britain had criticised the way in which Stalin had tried to turn the Soviet Union
into an industrialised country. Many people had died in the process. However, Stalin was a strong opponent of
Germany and so the USA and Britain needed to work with the Soviet Union to defeat Hitler. Once the war came to
an end, however, the ideological differences between them meant it was impossible to agree on how post-war
Europe should be governed.

Summary of the differences between the Soviet Union and the West

Politics Only one party Free elections with a choice of parties

Social structure Everyone is equal Some people have more power than others (because of family background or wealth)

Economy All property owned by the state, not individuals Private ownership of property

Rights Not many individual rights More individual freedoms

Franklin D. Roosevelt President of the USA: 1933-45

He believed strongly in democracy. He did not trust Stalin but he was not always as tough in negotiations with Stalin as
Churchill would have liked. Roosevelt believed any long-term settlement would only be possible if the Soviet Union was accepted
as a superpower.

Winston Churchill Prime minister of Britain: 1940-45, 1951-55

Churchill did not trust Stalin. He saw his role as trying to stop the Soviet Union from taking control of eastern Europe.

Figure 1.1 Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt.

Negotiations When leaders of different countries meet to discuss an issue.

Superpower A country which is unusually strong and influences other countries. The USA and the Soviet Union were
both superpowers.

Joseph Stalin Leader of the Soviet Union: 1920s-1953

Stalin strengthened communist rule in the Soviet Union. He believed that the West wanted to destroy communism, so the
Soviet Union had to stand firm in any negotiations with the Western ‘superpower’, the USA, and its close ally, Britain.

Defeating Nazi Germany was a victory for capitalism and democracy.

To stop a war from happening again, we need to stop communism from spreading.

was a victory for communism.

Communism is dangerous. We need to protect other countries from it.

USA Figure 1.2 US and Soviet thinking after the Second World War.

A new world order

The Second World War changed world politics. The ‘old powers’, like Britain and France, were now less important than they had been. Two new
‘superpowers’, the Soviet Union and the USA had replaced them. Their military and economic strength were responsible for the defeat of Germany
but their strength also made the Soviet Union and the USA rivals.

The Grand Alliance

In the Second World War, the Grand Alliance was formed between the USA, the Soviet Union and Britain to defeat Germany and Japan. Although the three
countries had formed an alliance, there was no real change in how they viewed each other. The USA and Britain, in particular, distrusted communism, and
Stalin realised that the West would not want to take any actions that made the Soviet Union stronger in the long run.

The leaders of The Grand Alliance nations met three times during the war: at Tehran (1943), Yalta (February 1945) and Potsdam (July 1945).
