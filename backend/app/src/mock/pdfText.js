in the evolution of classical physics. Even before the time of Galileo and
Newton, Nicolaus Copernicus1 had shown that the complicated and imprecise
Aristotelian method of computing the motions of the planets, based on the assumption
that Earth was located at the center of the universe, could be made much simpler,
though no more accurate, if it were assumed that the planets move about the Sun
instead of Earth. Although Copernicus did not publish his work until very late in
life, it became widely known through correspondence with his contemporaries and
helped pave the way for acceptance a century later of the heliocentric theory of
planetary motion. While the Copernican theory led to a dramatic revolution in human
thought, the aspect that concerns us here is that it did not consider the location of
Earth to be special or favored in any way. Thus, the laws of physics discovered
on Earth could apply equally well with any point taken as the center — i.e., the
same equations would be obtained regardless of the origin of coordinates. This
invariance of the equations that express the laws of physics is what we mean by the
term relativity.
We will begin this chapter by investigating briefly the relativity of Newton’s
laws and then concentrate on the theory of relativity as developed by Albert Einstein
(1879–1955). The theory of relativity consists of two rather different theories, the
special theory and the general theory. The special theory, developed by Einstein and
others in 1905, concerns the comparison of measurements made in different frames
of reference moving with constant velocity relative to each other. Contrary to popular opinion, the special theory is not difficult to understand. Its consequences, which
can be derived with a minimum of mathematics, are applicable in a wide variety of
situations in physics and engineering. On the other hand, the general theory, also
developed by Einstein (around 1916), is concerned with accelerated reference frames
and gravity. Although a thorough understanding of the general theory requires more
sophisticated mathematics (e.g., tensor analysis), a number of its basic ideas and
important predictions can be discussed at the level of this book. The general theory
is of great importance in cosmology and in understanding events that occur in the 1-1 The Experimental Basis of Relativity
Classical Relativity
In 1687, with the publication of the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,
Newton became the first person to generalize the observations of Galileo and others
into the laws of motion that occupied much of your attention in introductory physics.
The second of Newton’s three laws is

Equation 1-1 also includes the first law, the law of inertia, by implication: if ,
then also, i.e., . (Recall that letters and symbols in boldface type are
vectors.)
As it turns out, Newton’s laws of motion only work correctly in inertial reference
frames, that is, reference frames in which the law of inertia holds.2 They also have the
remarkable property that they are invariant, or unchanged, in any reference frame that
moves with constant velocity relative to an inertial frame. Thus, all inertial frames are
equivalent—there is no special or favored inertial frame relative to which absolute
measurements of space and time could be made. Two such inertial frames are illustrated in Figure 1-1, arranged so that corresponding axes in S and are parallel and
S moves in the direction at velocity x v for an observer in S (or S moves in the x direction at velocity for an observer in ). Figures 1-2 and 1-3 illustrate the conceptual differences between inertial and noninertial reference frames. Transformation
of the position coordinates and the velocity components of S into those of is the

1.1 What Is Philosophy?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify sages (early philosophers) across historical traditions.
• Explain the connection between ancient philosophy and the origin of the sciences.
• Describe philosophy as a discipline that makes coherent sense of a whole.
• Summarize the broad and diverse origins of philosophy.
It is difficult to define philosophy. In fact, to do so is itself a philosophical activity, since philosophers are
attempting to gain the broadest and most fundamental conception of the world as it exists. The world includes
nature, consciousness, morality, beauty, and social organizations. So the content available for philosophy is
both broad and deep. Because of its very nature, philosophy considers a range of subjects, and philosophers
cannot automatically rule anything out. Whereas other disciplines allow for basic assumptions, philosophers
cannot be bound by such assumptions. This open-endedness makes philosophy a somewhat awkward and
confusing subject for students. There are no easy answers to the questions of what philosophy studies or how
one does philosophy. Nevertheless, in this chapter, we can make some progress on these questions by (1)
looking at past examples of philosophers, (2) considering one compelling definition of philosophy, and (3)
looking at the way academic philosophers today actually practice philosophy.
Historical Origins of Philosophy
One way to begin to understand philosophy is to look at its history. The historical origins of philosophical
thinking and exploration vary around the globe. The word philosophy derives from ancient Greek, in which the
philosopher is a lover or pursuer (philia) of wisdom (sophia). But the earliest Greek philosophers were not
known as philosophers; they were simply known as sages. The sage tradition provides an early glimpse of
philosophical thought in action. Sages are sometimes associated with mathematical and scientific discoveries
and at other times with their political impact. What unites these figures is that they demonstrate a willingness
to be skeptical of traditions, a curiosity about the natural world and our place in it, and a commitment to
applying reason to understand nature, human nature, and society better. The overview of the sage tradition
that follows will give you a taste of philosophy’s broad ambitions as well as its focus on complex relations
between different areas of human knowledge. There are some examples of women who made contributions to
philosophy and the sage tradition in Greece, India, and China, but these were patriarchal societies that did not
provide many opportunities for women to participate in philosophical and political discussions.
The Sages of India, China, Africa, and Greece
In classical Indian philosophy and religion, sages play a central role in both religious mythology and in the
practice of passing down teaching and instruction through generations. The Seven Sages, or Saptarishi (seven
rishis in the Sanskrit language), play an important role in sanatana dharma, the eternal duties that have come
to be identified with Hinduism but that predate the establishment of the religion. The Seven Sages are partially
considered wise men and are said to be the authors of the ancient Indian texts known as the Vedas. But they
are partly mythic figures as well, who are said to have descended from the gods and whose reincarnation
marks the passing of each age of Manu (age of man or epoch of humanity). The rishis tended to live monastic
lives, and together they are thought of as the spiritual and practical forerunners of Indian gurus or teachers,
even up to today. They derive their wisdom, in part, from spiritual forces, but also from tapas, or the
meditative, ascetic, and spiritual practices they perform to gain control over their bodies and minds. The
stories of the rishis are part of the teachings that constitute spiritual and philosophical practice in
contemporary Hinduism.
Despite the fact that classical Indian culture is patriarchal, women figures play an important role in the earliest
writings of the Vedic tradition (the classical Indian religious and philosophical tradition). These women figures
are partly connected to the Indian conception of the fundamental forces of nature—energy, ability, strength,
effort, and power—as feminine. This aspect of God was thought to be present at the creation of the world. The
Rig Veda, the oldest Vedic writings, contains hymns that tell the story of Ghosha, a daughter of Rishi Kakshivan,
who had a debilitating skin condition (probably leprosy) but devoted herself to spiritual practices to learn how
to heal herself and eventually marry. Another woman, Maitreyi, is said to have married the Rishi Yajnavalkya
(himself a god who was cast into mortality by a rival) for the purpose of continuing her spiritual training. She
was a devoted ascetic and is said to have composed 10 of the hymns in the Rig Veda. Additionally, there is a
famous dialogue between Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya in the Upanishads (another early, foundational collection
of texts in the Vedic tradition) about attachment to material possessions, which cannot give a person
happiness, and the achievement of ultimate bliss through knowledge of the Absolute (God).
Another woman sage named Gargi also participates in a celebrated dialogue with Yajnavalkya on natural
philosophy and the fundamental elements and forces of the universe. Gargi is characterized as one of the most
knowledgeable sages on the topic, though she ultimately concedes that Yajnavalkya has greater knowledge. In
these brief episodes, these ancient Indian texts record instances of key women who attained a level of
enlightenment and learning similar to their male counterparts. Unfortunately, this early equality between the
sexes did not last. Over time Indian culture became more patriarchal, confining women to a dependent and
subservient role. Perhaps the most dramatic and cruel example of the effects of Indian patriarchy was the
ritual practice of sati, in which a widow would sometimes immolate herself, partly in recognition of the “fact”
that following the death of her husband, her current life on Earth served no further purpose (Rout 2016).
Neither a widow’s in-laws nor society recognized her value
