# Turing Teacher AI Assistant

Welcome to the Turing Teacher AI Assistant, a revolutionary tool revolutionizing the way we approach teaching preparation.


## Problem

Teaching has proven to be an overwhelming career, with almost 13% of newly qualified teachers leaving the profession within the first year of their qualification. This percentage increases to almost 19% leaving after their second year. The major reasons for this include an overwhelming workload, stress, and constant concern for creating high-quality class material.

## Solution

Our solution, the Turing Teacher AI Assistant, aims to reduce the workload on teachers by helping them with class preparation. Our application is designed to automate the class creation process based on the teacher's profile, class topic, reference books, and previous presentations. This assistance in class planning and preparation relieves the workload and stress on teachers.
